# **KCL AI Society 2022/2023: Lab 2** - Object Detection with Deep Learning
By Jacob Casey (AI Lab Leader)

**Aim**

*   Utilise the power of advanced and state-of-the-art deep learning to detect objects accurately

**Objectives**

*   Perform image processing to first denoise images with opencv 
*   Familiarise yourself with open-source transfer-learning strategies
*   Leverage the compute of pre-trained models (from research teams at Meta AI, Google, etc.)
*    Detect fighter jets from ariel photographs!
